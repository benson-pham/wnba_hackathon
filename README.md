<h2><span style="color:#2d7eea">Data Overview</span></h2>

We are looking at the 2022 WNBA season and analyzing player performance throughout the campaign. The Look ML model includes standard
basketball stats (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) as well as important dimensional data (Age, Team, University, etc.).

The resulting dashboard will be our submission to the 2022 Cloud BI Hackathon.
