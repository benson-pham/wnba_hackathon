<h2><span style="color:#2d7eea">Overview</span></h2>

We are looking at the 2022 WNBA season and analyzing player performance throughout the campaign. The Look ML model includes standard
basketball stats (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) as well as important dimensional data (Age, Team, University, etc.).

Our primary purpose is to take Dean Oliver's Four Factors model and see if his methodology can be applied to the WNBA as well. We took 2022 WNBA player
data and fit it to his model with a few adjustments for season length.

The results are outstanding and we are proud to announce his model holds up even in the WNBA!

The resulting dashboard will be our submission to the 2022 Cloud BI Hackathon. Our visualizations will show this ouput as well as other key
player statistics. We also used one custom visualiation in or dashboard.
